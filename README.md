# TableBookingSystem
This simple piece of software is to demonstrate my coding skills for YouManage.

I have not been able to implement this to a database to store the reservations for the restaurant however I have managed to produce a user interface for the customers to reserve a table.

I am eager to improve my coding and design skills with an opportunity at YouManage I feel I would benefit from training and I can provide dedication to continually work hard to enhance the goal that YouManage sets out to achieve.

To make a booking, simply select the amount of people, date and time from the drop down menus. You will be required to enter a valid e-mail address to complete the booking!
